          <p>At Morey Construction and Consulting, we take great pride in our heritage restoration and masonry repair projects. This particular undertaking was no exception, as we meticulously dismantled and rebuilt deteriorated stone areas to ensure the structural integrity of the wall. In addition, we expertly carried out chip and repoint work on the stone wall below the terrace, seamlessly restoring its original beauty. As a finishing touch, we supplied and installed new Kingston Limestone caps, matched in size and finish to the existing materials, ensuring the entire structure looks and functions at its best.</p>
