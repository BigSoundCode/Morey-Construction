          <h4>Heritage Masonry Consulting and Restoration</h4>
          <p>Heritage buildings require an individualized approach to revitalize them properly. Care needs to be taken throughout the process with detailed analysis, correct materials, and a skilled implementation to not only restore but also prevent any missteps along the way. We carefully execute each project step with management working alongside skilled trades to merge plan and performance. With our approach, we have reached masterful outcomes on some of the most iconic structures in the area.</p>

            <h5>Chip Repointing</h5>
            <p>Harsh weather and time can erode pointing, causing leaks and further damage to builds. At the first sign of cracks in the mortar, gaps between bricks or stone, loose brickwork, or water on the interior walls, chip repointing should be completed to avoid significant damage to the structure.    </p>

            <h5>Stone Replacement/Repair</h5>
            <p>Where the stone or brick has been damaged, we opt for repairs and provide replacements when necessary. We take the utmost care in accurately matching the original stone.</p>

            <h5>Dismantle & Rebuild</h5>
            <p>A dismantle and rebuild may be required when significant repairs are needed. A full assessment, including the building's structure and points of concern, is identified to determine the complete project scope. During more extensive restorations like this, increased precision to match the building's original design is taken.    </p>

            <h5>Reinforcement</h5>
            <p>Heritage buildings have stood the test of time, which also means environmental factors and eroded materials can impact the structural integrity of the building. Our team conducts a thorough assessment of the state of the structure and provides reinforcement where required.
